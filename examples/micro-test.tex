\def\sample{Prague has been a political, cultural, and economic centre of central Europe
with waxing and waning fortunes during its 1,100-year existence. Founded during
the Romanesque and flourishing by the Gothic and Renaissance eras, Prague was
not only the capital of the Czech state, but also the seat of two Holy Roman
Emperors and thus also the capital of the Holy Roman Empire. It was an
important city to the Habsburg Monarchy and its Austro-Hungarian Empire and
after World War I became the capital of Czechoslovakia. The city played major
roles in the Protestant Reformation, the Thirty Years' War, and in 20th-century
history, during both World Wars and the post-war Communist era.}
